1. If you mean organization, that may prove a bit difficult at first due to my tactics. Though my work will be cleaned after I made sure
   everything is working order.

2. My Thrift store would have a class base called "Inventories" it would include the variables "Glass_Vase, Sofa, and Novelty_Hat" and possibly more.
  The variables will need to be interchangeable, so that I can switch their locations from the Store's Inventory to the Character's Inventory.

3. The data types i'll be using arrays on would be for "Narration" and possibly the "Currency".

4. My two classes containing the variables would be the "Currency" and "Fail" class, the Currency would have the Player(and Store)Money Var and
  the Fail would so far have "Price" but it may change.

5. I'll be honest I don't know what an "overloaded constructor" is or how to use/fix it. Not yet that is.

6. I think I have a basic understanding of object aggregation. Its used when combining two objects together to create a parent-child relationship
   with them. Though i'm not too sure when I would need to use it.

7. Polymorphism is practically having one or more classes use another class' material for the creation of something on their part. Though I may
   need to find out what/how I would use it (with).

8. I may not know how to make the system read from a text file too well, but the writing portion is similar to just writing the "Narrative" into
   text with qoutes.

9. The Debugging tool should be simple to use. Though if a problem rises, i'll call for help.
